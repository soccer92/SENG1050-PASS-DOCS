						<h3>Welcome to the SENG1050 PASS page</h3>
                        <p>I'll be uploading any of the content which is able to be presented publically here, below is a series of links to each page that we've been working on. See getting-started if you're new to catch up and create some branches! (That's right, you'll learn real-world skills used by real companies :D)</p>
                        <p>Please note, due to relatively new security measures in modern browsers relating to JS accessing information stored in other local files (it opens a potential exploit to send malicious html documents). The JavaScript on this page likely won't run unless hosted by a server. You could run apache to get around this and host your own site locally, but it's likely not worth the effort and is out of scope.</p>

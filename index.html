            <h3>Welcome to the SENG1050 PASS page</h3>
            <p>
              I'll be uploading any of the content which is able to be presented
              publically here, below is a series of links to each page that
              we've been working on. See getting-started if you're new to catch
              up and create some branches! (That's right, you'll learn
              real-world skills used by real companies!)
            </p>
            <p>
              Please note, due to relatively new security measures in modern
              browsers relating to JS accessing information stored in other
              local files (it opens a potential exploit to send malicious html
              documents). The JavaScript on this page likely won't run unless
              hosted by a server. You could run apache to get around this and
              host your own site locally, but it's likely not worth the effort
              and is out of scope.
